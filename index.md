## We want to make things last

_**fair**devices_ wants to become an association, listed as a German _"eingetragener Verein"_. You are more than welcome to join and become a founding member!

The industrial world as we know it exploits too many resources, creates products with planned life cycles, and produces too much waste. We would like to stop this circle by a simple solution: open hardware!

So many devices are thrown away even though only a small component is defective. So many devices are designed with planned obsolescence in mind.

**We want to change that.**

## What is the schedule?

First, we would like to found an association. Everybody is welcome to join.

Secondly, we will form work teams for all technical, legal, financial, public relations, and other matters. Everyone may participate according to their abilities.

Thirdly, we will endeavor to obtain funding. The establishment of a foundation will support the technical work.

## What about laundry machines?

The laundry machine is chosen as a first project item. Usually a small relay refuses its function or the main bearing starts rattling due to worn dampers. Within _**fair**devices_, we would like to develop a universal circuit board that will fit most of the conventional machines to secure a second, potentially infinite, repairable life.

## More devices to comeâ€¦

It will be up to us to decide what we will make to last. There are no limits!
