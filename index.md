# We want to make things last

fairdevices wants to become an association, listed as a German _"eingetragener Verein"_. You are more than welcome to join and become a founding member!

The industrial world as we know it exploits to many resources, creates products with planed life cycles, and produces too much waste. We would like to stop this circle by a simple solution: open hardware!

So many devices are thrown away even though only a small component is defective. So many devices are constructed with a planned obsolescence.

We want to change that.

## What is the schedule?

First, we would like to found an association. Everybody is welcome to join.

Secondly, we will form work teams for all technical, legal, financial, public relation, … matters. Everyone may participate according to his or hers abilities.

Thirdly, we will endeavor to obtain funding. The erection of a foundation will support the technical work.

## What about laundry machines?

The laundry machines is chosen as a first project item. Usually a small relay refuses its function or the main bearing starts rattling because the dampers lost friction first. Within fairdevices, we would like to develop a universal platine, that will fit most of the conventional machines to secure a second, potentially infinite, repairabel life.

## More devices to come…

It will be up to us, what we will make to last. No limits!
