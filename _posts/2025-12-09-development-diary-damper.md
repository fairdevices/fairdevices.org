# Development Journal
# Universal Washing Machine Damper

## 1 Introduction 
This is the development journal for an open source hardware washing machine damper. The damper is the most important part for long mechanical life of a washing machine. ...

## 2 General technical facts

what are typical damper types? which one fail sooner, which ones last? damper parameters? loads/stresses/frequencies/ damping-power /thermal losses/ differential equations that describe the system of mass/spring coeff/damper —> forces —-> design

+ length: tbd.
+ mounting holes: 8.0 mm for fitting screw
 
## 3 fundamental differential equations for mass-spring-damper-sytsem
### octace script for calculations
harmonic calculation of forces depending on rpm, loading/mass of spinning unit, ...
